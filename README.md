## Hey! ðŸŒŠ

I'm Cass Bunting, a graphics-programmer, technical artist, and (as of recently)   
web developer in Vancouver, BC. I'm excited about real time rendering, developing   
useful, streamlined technical tools for other artists and developers, and creating  
unique interactive experiences.  

Aside from working with graphics, my overwhelmingly numerous hobbies include
playing music, hiking, cooking, reading about history and social theory,
creative writing, andâ€”of courseâ€”playing video games.
